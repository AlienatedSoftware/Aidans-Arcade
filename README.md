## Introduction

Aidan's Arcade -  Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

The goal of Aidan's Arcade is to act as an safe haven to save people from boredom by allowing them to play some quick games straight from the web. 
Entertainment is the primarily focus of what this project intends to deliever for the users. Giving users a choice on what game(s) they can play on that are very simple
and easy to control.

Aidan's Arcade was created with desktop users in mind, as the primarily target audience will be either students or workers that want to kill time during breaks or fulfill the
space they have created during their procrastination. Users will also have to option to play these games on handheld devices as well.

It has a clean, simplistic and minimal design to not make the screen too distracting, so the users can get straight into the game(s) with ease and focus.

This is my second of four Milestone Porjects that I must complete during the Full Stack Development Program over at Code Institute.
The primarily requirements for this milestone is to make an interactive front end website with the use of **JavaScript**.

## Testing

Based on the User Stories above, all users will be able to follow the flow of the website to find what they came for according to their stories.

Google developer tools was used manually to check and test the live project on all different screen sizes. Used multiple devices and feedback from family & friends who went to the deployed site on their devices.

## Issues and Bugs

**Navbar / Matching Game Bug**
- Originally, there was a real graphical designed logo for this project. However it became groundbreaking when it came to the matching game, as the way the matching game works, its coded to be played around with images as the matching cards, however, this became problematic as the code would glitch and act as if the logo was one of the potentional card matching images, along side the real cards. This caused the logo to be replaced with a card, and broke the navbar completely. To fix this, a simple logo replacement was put into use, with an icon from fontawesome, instead of an image logo.

**Flappy Game Bug**
- This is by far the most complicated JS code I have done, there were a lot of problems along the way when it came to responsiveness.

## Deployment

This website was developed in multiple editors, Gitpod and vsCode, and version controlling was utilised via local (git) and online (github) repository technologies.

Deploying this application was achieved through Github pages by:

* Selecting the Repository from my list in the Github Dashboard.
* Navigating to "Settings" and to the "Github Pages" section.
* From the "Source" section, click on the dropdown and select "main" branch from the associated list.
* Once "main" branch is selected, the page will auto-refresh and navigate the user to the top of the page with a visual ribbon display detailing, "Github pages source saved", indicating the success of the deployment.
* The link to the website can then be found under the "Github Pages" section, with a ribbon notification stating:
    "Your site is published at "https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/"


To clone the website:

Select the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Click on the "Clone or download" green button located above and to the right of the "Add file" button.
* Click on the "clipboard icon" to the right of the Git URL to copy the web URL of the Clone.
* Open your preferred editor/IDE and navigate to the terminal window.
* Type `git clone <paste-clone-url-here>` and press "Enter/Return" on your keyboard.
* This will create a clone of the project for you.
